# Encrypted Section Widget for ImpressPages.org

ImpressPages(http://www.impresspages.org/) is a nice CMS.
I am currently working on a Plugin(http://www.impresspages.org/docs/plugin).

I want to have a "Encrypted Section" Widget(http://www.impresspages.org/docs/widgets) that has **strong client side encryption**.

This is currently alpha software under heavy development!
